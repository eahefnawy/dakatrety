This was a quick 48 hours weekend project, but it got me into trouble! check out [How a Weekend Project Almost Got Me Kicked out of School](https://medium.com/@eahefnawy/dakatrety-com-the-story-c8caa62e4298)!

PS: I know the code looks shitty! But please don't judge me! I wrote all 5184 lines of code in 48 hours straight!
 
This project is powered by Meteor, MongoDB, Digital Ocean, CloudFlare, 8 cups of coffee & my super powers ;)
