:speak_no_evil: A web app for university students to rate their professors anonymously and publicly.

This was a quick 48 hours weekend project, but it got me into trouble! check out [How a Weekend Project Almost Got Me Kicked out of School](http://medium.com)!

PS: I know the code looks shitty! But please don't judge me! I wrote all 5184 lines of code in 48 hours straight!

This project is powered by Meteor, MongoDB, Digital Ocean, CloudFlare & my super powers ;)
